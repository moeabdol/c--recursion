# Recursion Examples in C++
Sample programs to demonstrate the concept of recursion in C++.

## Program List
1. `tail_head.cpp` - Simple recursive program to demo ascending and descending
   statements during recursion.
2. `static_variable.cpp` - Recursive program to demo how a static variable inside
   a recursive function will be treated as a global variable.
3. `tree_recursion.cpp` - Recursive program to show tree recursion. That is when
   a function calls itself more than once.
